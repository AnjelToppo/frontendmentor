    Expected behaviour
    Below you will find the BMI ranges and their weight classifications. Based on the person's BMI results, add their
    weight classification to the sentence "Your BMI suggests you’re" within the results component.

    Underweight: BMI less than 18.5
    Healthy weight: BMI 18.5 to 24.9
    Overweight: BMI 25 to 29.9
    Obese: BMI 30 or greater
    Add the individual's healthy weight range based on the lower and upper BMI categorisations and the person's height.

What your BMI result means

A BMI range of 18.5 to 24.9 is considered a 'healthy weight.' Maintaining a
healthy weight may lower your chances of experiencing health issues later on,
such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. Aim for a nutritious diet with reduced
fat and sugar content, incorporating ample fruits and vegetables. Additionally,
strive for regular physical activity, ideally about 30 minutes daily for
five days a week.

Healthy eating
Healthy eating promotes weight control, disease prevention, better digestion,
immunity, mental clarity, and mood.

Regular exercise
Exercise improves fitness, aids weight control, elevates mood, and reduces disease
risk, fostering wellness and longevity.

Adequate sleep
Sleep enhances mental clarity, emotional stability, and physical wellness, promoting
overall restoration and rejuvenation.

Limitations of BMI

Although BMI is often a practical indicator of healthy weight, it is not suited for
every person. Specific groups should carefully consider their BMI outcomes, and in
certain cases, the measurement may not be beneficial to use.

Gender
The development and body fat composition of girls and boys vary with age. Consequently,
a child's age and gender are considered when evaluating their BMI.

Age
In aging individuals, increased body fat and muscle loss may cause BMI to underestimate
body fat content.

Muscle
BMI may misclassify muscular individuals as overweight or obese, as it doesn't
differentiate muscle from fat.

Pregnancy
Expectant mothers experience weight gain due to their growing baby. Maintaining a
healthy pre-pregnancy BMI is advisable to minimise health risks for both mother
and child.

Race
Certain health concerns may affect individuals of some Black and Asian origins at
lower BMIs than others. To learn more, it is advised to discuss this with your
GP or practice nurse.
